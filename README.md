I implemented linear regression model from scratch using numpy on a house pricing data.
Used two input parameters
1. Size of Lot
2. Number of Rooms

The parameters which I got from Numpy implemetation were really close to the Sk- Learn implemetation

Parameters from Numpy Implemetation:
  w1 = -2.206
  w2 = 114.501
  b = -38.045
Parameters from Sk-Learn Implementation
  w1 = -2.185
  w2 =114.760
  b = - 41.522

  Really Excited to dive deeper into Machine Learning
