# LinearRegression
Implementing Linear regression from scratch just using numpy and comparing it with sk_learn results.


I implented Linear Regression using numpy on house pricing data including two input parameters
1. Size of Lot
2. Number of Rooms

The parameters which I got using Numpy implementation are really close to those of sk learn implementation
Numpy parameters
w1 = -2.206
w2 = 114.501
w3 = -38.045
Sk learn parameters
w1 = -2.180
w2 = 114.760
b = -41.521

Really exicited to dive deeper into Machine Learning.
